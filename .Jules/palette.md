## 2024-05-24 - Accessibility Labels for Icon-Only Links
**Learning:** Icon-only links (like those in navigation bars) are invisible to screen readers without explicit labels.
**Action:** Always verify that elements containing only `<Icon />` or similar components have an `aria-label` describing their destination or action.
