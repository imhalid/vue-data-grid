## 2024-05-23 - Accessible Names for Icon-Only Links
**Learning:** Icon-only interactive elements (like links or buttons) must have an accessible name, such as an `aria-label` attribute, because visual icons (even with `aria-hidden="true"`) are not perceived by screen readers.
**Action:** Always verify that icon-only buttons have a descriptive `aria-label` that conveys the action or destination.
